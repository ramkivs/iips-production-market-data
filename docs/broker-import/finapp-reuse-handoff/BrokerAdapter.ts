/**
 * WP-FB-IMPORT-BROKER-01 — Broker adapter contract.
 *
 * Mirrors the BankStatementAdapter shape (id, displayName, canHandle,
 * canHandleRows, parse) but produces canonical `Holding[]` instead of
 * `BankStatementRecord[]`. The two adapter families are intentionally
 * separate: brokers emit first-class Holdings (D-01); bank statements
 * emit Transactions. The shared infrastructure is the detect / parse /
 * normalize shape, not the type system.
 *
 * This file is additive. It does not modify BankStatementAdapter or any
 * other existing import infrastructure. It introduces the minimum surface
 * required for WP-04 (Zerodha) and is shaped to be re-used by WP-05
 * (Dhan) and WP-06 (Groww) without modification.
 *
 * Parser/lifecycle boundary (per the WP-04 authority record §12):
 *   The broker adapter does NOT query existing holdings, does NOT compute
 *   new/updated/unchanged/closed_absent, does NOT persist, and does NOT
 *   call HoldingAssetCollisionGuard. It produces Holding candidates
 *   with `status: "active"` and a parser-generated id. Lifecycle
 *   reconciliation is the import-service's responsibility (WP-08).
