/**
 * WP-FB-IMPORT-BROKER-01 — Broker format detector.
 *
 * Mirrors the BankStatementAdapter registry pattern from
 * ImportFormatDetector. Registered broker adapters (one per broker
 * export shape — Zerodha for WP-04, plus Dhan and Groww in later
 * work-packages) are tried in order; the first adapter whose
 * structural detection returns a positive match wins.
 *
 * This file is additive. It does not modify ImportFormatDetector or
 * any bank-adapter wiring. Brokers and bank-statements are
 * intentionally separate registries to avoid false cross-detection
 * (a file that incidentally matches both a bank schema and a broker
 * schema must be presented to the user as one or the other, not
 * silently coerced).
 *
 * The detector is content-based: filename MUST NOT be the only
 * signal. Each adapter's `canHandle` / `canHandleRows` performs a
 * structural header-schema check.
